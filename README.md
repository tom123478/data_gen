# 🍅 Advantages of synthetic ocr data
OCR, especially Chinese OCR, is very sensitive to the ratio of characters in the training data. 
Increasing the frequency of a certain character in the training set can significantly improve the model's recognition ability of the character.
Synthetic data can help us deal with business bad cases quickly and at low cost.
